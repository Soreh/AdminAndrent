the only suggestions I came across was to remove --prod and use --aot --uglifyjs --minifyjs --minifycss --release instead which does not have the same effect as --prod as far as loading time of startup is concerned and to downgrade firebase to 4.12.1 which is unacceptable since version 4.13.0 has a critical bug fix.
